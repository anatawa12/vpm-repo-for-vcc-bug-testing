# Anatawa12's Test VPM Repository for VCC's bug

This is a test repository for VCC's bug.

There are several bugs in VCC.
However, for real-world case, package author will and wants to workaround bugs by updating their packages.
So, I made this repository to keep buggy packages forever for future releases.
